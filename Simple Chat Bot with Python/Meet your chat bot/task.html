<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Digital personal assistants help people drive cars, plan their day, and buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.</p><p>In this project, you will develop, step by step, a simple bot that will help you study programming.</p><p><img alt='illustration for the "Meet your chat bot" programming project with a digital avatar representing a friendly and simple chat bot on a computer screen' height="1024" src="https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-MKkIzIbs7Q3mcwUsdWxtLDXZ?se=2023-12-26T09%3A22%3A00Z&amp;sp=r&amp;sv=2021-08-06&amp;sr=b&amp;rscc=max-age%3D31536000%2C%20immutable&amp;rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3D3390c312-af58-4135-b5aa-f2bcdae9a156.webp&amp;sig=9z4tY8rOVoOoSuVSHLel%2BenqtQOdloFa3VbaIgKKdRA%3D" width="1792"/></p><h5 id="objective">Objective</h5><p>For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the year it was created. First impressions count!</p><p>Your program should print the following lines:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
I was created in {birth_year}.</code></pre><p>Instead of <code class="java">{bot_name}</code>, print any name you choose and replace <code class="java">{birth_year}</code> with the current year (four digits). You don't need to take any input at this stage.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.</code></pre><p>Here's the result with your bot named <strong>Aid</strong>, and <strong>2023</strong> as its birth year. Feel free to modify the values, but make sure to print exactly two lines.</p>
